[28 September 2007]

* Refactoring.

[29 June 2007]

[3 June 2007]

* Improve STI ordering

*  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE

   To jump more than one record forward or back, pass :number => x to next or previous, not just the number.
   Number defaults to 1.
   
   Old: person.next(10)
   New: person.next(:number => 10)
   
   This allows options to be passed to the find method when the record is instantiated:
   
     person.next(:include => :groups)
